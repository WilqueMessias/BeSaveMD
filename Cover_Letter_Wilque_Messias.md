**To: Hiring Manager**  
**Re: Application for Software Developer**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your team in Canada. As an IT professional with a solid foundation in computer science and a proven track record of developing innovative, high-impact solutions, I believe my blend of technical expertise and leadership experience makes me a valuable asset for any forward-thinking organization.

During my time at the **Polícia Civil do Estado de Goiás**, I independently spearheaded the creation of a tax process automation system. This project was not just about writing code; it involved end-to-end responsibility—from gathering complex requirements to designing the architecture (Python/Django) and training users. The result was a significant reduction in operational errors and resource savings for the state. This experience sharpened my ability to deliver robust, secure, and production-ready applications that solve real-world problems.

My technical toolkit includes:
*   **Backend:** Python (Django, Flask), Node.js.
*   **Frontend:** JavaScript/TypeScript (React).
*   **Data:** PostgreSQL, SQL, Data Validation, and Processing.
*   **DevOps/Tools:** Docker, Git/GitHub, API Integration, and Electronic Document Signing.

Beyond my technical skills, I bring a unique perspective from my experience as a **Digital Content Creator** at WE Produções LTDA. Managing a multi-platform strategy and leading a team to engage over 4.5 million followers has developed my leadership, strategic planning, and professional communication skills to a high level. I understand how to bridge the gap between technical requirements and user needs, ensuring that the solutions I build are not only functional but also intuitive and engaging.

I am highly motivated to contribute to the Canadian tech ecosystem and am currently seeking opportunities that offer Labor Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) and work permit sponsorship. While I currently hold a visitor visa, I am fully committed to the relocation process and am eager to bring my passion for innovation, process optimization, and user experience to a Canadian team. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Science and hold a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your team’s needs.

Sincerely,

**Wilque Messias de Lima**
