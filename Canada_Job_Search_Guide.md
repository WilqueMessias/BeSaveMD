# Canada Job Search Guide: Software & Automation

Finding a job in Canada from Brazil requires a targeted strategy, focusing on employers already approved to hire international talent (LMIA).

## 1. Using the Canada Job Bank (Official)
The [Job Bank](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/) is the most transparent platform for sponsorship status.

### How to Search:
1.  Go to the [Advance Search](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/jobsearch/advanced) page.
2.  **Target Audience**: Scroll down to "Target Groups" and check **"Temporary Foreign Workers"**.
3.  **LMIA Status**: Check **"LMIA approved"** or **"LMIA requested"**. This filters for employers who are already in the process of sponsoring.
4.  **Keywords**: Use `Python`, `Django`, `Automation`, or `Software Developer`.

## 2. Using Indeed Canada & LinkedIn
Use "Boolean Search" to find sponsorship mentions directly in job descriptions.

### Keywords to use in the search bar:
- `Python LMIA`
- `Django sponsorship`
- `Software Developer work permit`
- `Automation Engineer relocation`

## 3. Specialized Recruiters for Brazilians
These platforms are designed specifically to help you bridge the gap between Brazil and Canada.

*   **VanHack**: The #1 platform for Brazilians. They have a "Talent Spotlight" and specific job boards for roles with **Sponsorship & Relocation**.
*   **Talentech**: Offers a "free, turnkey relocation solution" for international talent, supporting everything from interviews to work permits.
*   **Join Us**: A consulting firm that specializes in placing Brazilian IT professionals into Canadian organizations.
*   **Major Agencies**: Check tech divisions of **Hays Canada**, **Randstad Digital**, and **Robert Walters Canada**.

## 4. Companies Known for Sponsorship
These "Tech Giants" in Canada frequently hire internationally:
- **Shopify** (Huge remote-first culture, very sponsorship-friendly)
- **Amazon Canada**
- **Slack / Salesforce**
- **Wealthsimple**
- **PointClickCare** (Known for hiring developers with strong automation skills)

## 5. Top Canadian Tech Hubs for Your Profile
*   **Toronto/Kitchener-Waterloo (Ontario)**: The largest tech ecosystem. Very high demand for Python/Full-Stack.
*   **Vancouver (BC)**: Strong focus on software engineering and automation.
*   **Montreal (Quebec)**: Massive hub (requires basic French often, but English works for senior tech roles).

## 4. Your Unique "Islands of Strength"
In your applications, emphasize these three points:
1.  **Independent Automation**: You didn't just join a team; you *created* a solution for a government body from scratch. This shows "Senior" level initiative.
2.  **Scale & Communication**: 4.5M followers proof you can communicate complex ideas and lead people. In Canadian culture, "Soft Skills" are as important as "Hard Skills".
3.  **Relocation Ready**: Since you already have a visitor visa, you can mention you are ready to travel for in-person interviews if the company suggests it (though most tech interviews are remote).

## 5. Resume Tip
Ensure your resume uses the **Canadian Format**:
- No photo.
- No marital status or age.
- Focus on **Achievements** (e.g., "Reduced operational errors by X%") rather than just listing responsibilities.
